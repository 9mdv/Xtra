## Download APK

You can find released APKs [here](https://github.com/AndreyAsadchy/Xtra/releases).

## Project status

The app was removed from Google Play in April 2021. At the moment I am not interested in working on the project, but anyone is welcomed to make a contribution or leave a suggestion.

## Issues

As [Twitch deprecated their V5 API](https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2021/07/15/legacy-twitch-api-v5-shutdown-details-and-timeline/?utm_referrer=https://dev.twitch.tv/), in February 2022 the app will stop working for those who still have it installed. It is now required to [migrate](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/migration) to the new API.

## Reddit
I have created a [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/XtraForTwitch) where you can discuss the project.
